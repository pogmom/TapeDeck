# AC Tape Deck

Play Music Based on the Current Hour, Simulating Your Favorite Real-Time Video Game Soundtracks!

AC Tape Deck is a music player that emulates the real-time soundtrack feature of games like Animal Crossing. The music played at each hour is entirely customizable, letting you choose any song from imported files.

AC Tape Deck supports a total of 5 primary 24-hour playlists, background playback, seamless music importing, weather playlists, and a main screen that reflects the time of day and selected weather, with a changing background, homey pixel art, and a stylized clock!

AC Tape Deck is entirely free to use. The only in-app purchases are tips to show appreciation, and are not expected or required to unlock any app functionality.
